sentence=Button Control with Debouncing Filter
paragraph=This library allows you to control a pushbutton or any mechanical key. For each instantiated object it is possible to control only one key. The "button_loop" method must be placed in the loop function or in a timer to run constantly. The "pressed" method indicates that the button has been pressed. The blessing of this library is to eliminate the bouncing effect of mechanical switches.
